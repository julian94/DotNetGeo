# DotNetGeo

A project for serving geodata using the new OGC-API standards.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, here's some things that I wouldn't mind:

1. Adding a new Data Source.
2. Adding automated tests.
3. Fixing bugs.
4. Making feature requests or bug reports.

Otherwise, if you think something would be nice to have, make an issue about it because it's likely that someone else will also want it.


Codewise please keep to DotNet 6.
